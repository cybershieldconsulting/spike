Spike is a simple web application to manage [naxsi]( https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi] rules.
Rules are stored in a [sqlite]( https://www.sqlite.org/ ) database, and can be added,
deleted, modified, searched, importable and exportable in plain-text.

This software was initially created to help with keeping the [Doxi]( https://bitbucket.org/lazy_dogtown/doxi-rules/src )
rulesets up-to-date. It was created with love by the people of [mare system]( https://www.mare-system.de/ ) in 2011,
maintained by [8ack]( https://8ack.de/corporate ), and now, it's being adopted by the naxsi project.

You can take a look [here]( http://spike.nginx-goodies.com/rules/ ) for a  live (legacy) version.
